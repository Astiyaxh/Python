# Define a function called "factorial" that accepts a single number as input
#
# A factorial represents the product of all number up to, and including, that number.
# For example, 5 factorial is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
#
# Return the factorial calculation from your function. You should NOT use any kind of loops.
# Instead, utilize recursion. Your function MUST call itself.
# see sample input and return values below
# 
# factorial(1)  => 1
# factorial(2)  => 2
# factorial(3)  => 6
# factorial(4)  => 24
# factorial(5)  => 120

def factorial(number):
    if number == 1:
        return number 
    
    return number * factorial(number-1)

print(factorial(5))
