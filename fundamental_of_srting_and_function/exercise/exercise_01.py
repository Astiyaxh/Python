# Use the print function to output the text "I am a developer!"
# Remember -- case sensitivity matters in python.
# All characters and casings must match the ones in the string above.
print("I am a developer!")


# Use the print function to output the string "a ** b ** c"
# Make sure to use the proper keyword argument to seperate the values.
# Don't cheat by manually copying and pasting the string.
print("a", "b", "c", sep=" ** ")


# Help me out! When I print the two lines blow, they are
# seperated by a line break. what's peanut butter without
# jelly? NOTHING! Fix the code to ensure the second
# line picks up wherr the first line concludes. Your
# solution should have 2 print function calls.

# print("Peanut butter and")
# print("jelly")
print("Peanut butter and ", end="")
print("jelly")
